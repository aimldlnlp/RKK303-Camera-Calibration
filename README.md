# Camera Calibration with OpenCV ðŸ“¸

**Course:** RKK303 - Computer Vision

This project focuses on camera calibration using a ChArUco board, a combination of checkerboard and ArUco markers, to compute the intrinsic camera parameters and distortion coefficients. The calibration process was applied to a **HuatengVision industrial camera** equipped with a **45 mm focal length lens**, yielding a more accurate camera model for industrial applications, such as quality control and robotic vision systems.
